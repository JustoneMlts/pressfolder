  I might be weak
  but tonight set in on fire
  to defeat
  Your time has come to an end
  it's time to hail the king
  I'm not letting you forget
  it's the doll's city speaks

  In my head, they're in my head
  every colors every sound, every mistakes that I made
  are in my mind, they're in my mind
  You broke my heart you took my time
  and let me die

  Talk to me 
  Until you're gone
  I'm gonna disappear 
  It won't be long
  you're the air I love to breath
  you're the world in I belong
  hurt me please I will hurt you
  Until your body turns to cold

  In my head, they're in my head
  every colors every sound, every mistakes that I made
  are in my mind, they're in my mind
  You broke my heart you take my time
  and let me die
  You're in my head, you're in my head
  you're every colors every sounds, every silence that I break

export const bcLyrics = `Surrounded by the Mist inside my head
I had no, idea that nothing will ever be the same
Follow, my lead and hang the one who diggs our graves 
for their, own bliss
They will starve us all to death if they need

I won't let you down, letting yourself drown
And be their pawn, killing us all with
Your Brambling Crown, tearing us appart
And harden their thrones
Burrying us under

You, won't feel alone anymore we will be
Back home, you'll feel no pain and no one 
Above, can make you their slave it is our 
Last dawn, we'll make history on our own

I won't let you down, letting yourself drown
And be their pawn, killing us all with
Your Brambling Crown, tearing us appart
And harden their thrones
Burrying us under

Take me back home where
The sun shines and repair
My heart is cold and need to warm again

We will stand as a man
We'll break your chains and fly again
If I'm not coming home I'll still be there
I'll damn your name till the end of time
Your time has come tonight

I won't let you down, letting yourself drown
And be their pawn, killing us all with
Your Brambling Crown, tearing us appart
And harden their thrones
Burrying us under the weight of the
Guiltiness of all the wrong they've done
I don't want no more your salvation
Burrying you under the dirt we ate
forever and ever more

export const tsoabmLyrics = `Let me tell you a story
Of a man who couldn’t see
That he had all he needed
To achieve his dreams

From a loving family
And who believed in him
He decides to let them down
And escape from his fears

Ooh, ooh, there was a time
Ooh, ooh, there was a man

As he was getting older
He learned from the others
And changed all he was just 
To be accepted in this world

Only one memory 
Only one true love standing still
In the night when he felt empty
He played his guitar to dry his tears

Ooh, ooh, there was a time
Ooh, ooh, there was a man

Now he is by his own
And feels like he is doing wrong
He only likes to be on a drunk
Or to sing one of his songs

One day his time will come
And he will be alone
To face his life filled with demons
And maybe sing to his son

Ooh, ooh, there was a time
Ooh, ooh, there was a man

When he is gone
And the day is done
The sun will shine the same 
For everyone

When the darkness 
Comes home and
Let you see
His phantom you,
You'll look in the mirror
And you'll sing as one
Ooh, ooh, there was a time
Ooh, ooh, there was a man`;

export const radiostarLyrics = `It seems like you
are my best and my worst
It seems like you
are my pains and my hurts
But it seems like you 
are the one for me
And I dream of you
You are my whole world

You make me wanna leave 
For a better place
You make me wanna sing 
in the outter space
I don't want you to be lonely 
I don't want you to be here
With all the stains I see
And all the noise I hear

Let's run away with me 
I know a place to stay
Where all our dreams are real
And all our screams are fakes
The silence won't be break
We could just fly away
And all the sound we'll hear
Will be just in our heads
We'll dance with the stars
Collapsing to our death
But time will engrave
Our names untill the space
Unites to born again
Make us the best of paints
to draw the unique frame
of platon's greatest cave

Anywhere in the sky
I wanna see it shine
until the end of time

I wanna hear the sound
Of silence all around
As your eyes fall into mine 

It tears me apart when you're away
when you're alone under the rain
if it's my faith I'll fade away 
As you lead me to my grave
Give me the guts to wait my death

Please come with me 
listen to the stars
We will find our peace
Into the darkest sky

Anywhere in the sky
I wanna see it shine
until the end of time

I wanna hear the sound
Of silence all around
As your eyes fall into mine 


Anywhere in the sky
I wanna see it shine
until the end of time

I wanna hear the sound
Of silence all around
As your eyes fall into mine`;

Would you be. my ennemy ?
If I wern't. the tool you like me to be
Would you .stop to driving me crazy?
I think I'm wasting 
My mind
Wasting 
My time
I'm wasting my personality

I've waited for you
My whole world is blue
The Dementia I'm going through 
You picture a storm that I sew  

My eyes are looking out for you
Our graves are in bloom
My reason is becoming blurry

Hear the dementia wakin'up
You're more pretty than I thought
bring me back my shining light
I think I'm wasting
My mind
Wasting 
My time
I'm wasting my personality

I've waited for you
My whole world is blue 
The Dementia I'm going through 
You picture a storm that I sew  

My eyes are looking out for you
Our graves are in bloom
My reason is becoming blurry

I’ve come to a known place
The only one I’ve ever been
I Finally feel safe
To become the perfect human being

My eyes are looking out for you
Our graves are in bloom
My reason is becoming blurry

I've waited for you
My whole world is blue

Our graves are in bloom
My reason is becoming blurry

My eyes are looking out for you
Our graves are in bloom
My reason is becoming blurry
